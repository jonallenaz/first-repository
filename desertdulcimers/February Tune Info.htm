<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoPlainText>GROUND HOG - The original song dates from the mountains
of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Virginia and was probably written
around the turn of the 20th Century, or shortly before.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are dozens of verses for this
song, and a couple of variations on the tune.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>One verse is grounded in fact. Groundhog skins were often
used for banjo heads before the advent of plastic and store-bought hides. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>RED RIVER VALLEY - This a folk song and cowboy music
standard of controversial origins that has gone by different names-e.g.,
&quot;Cowboy Love Song&quot;, &quot;Bright Sherman Valley&quot;, &quot;Bright
Laurel Valley&quot;, &quot;In the Bright Mohawk Valley&quot;, and &quot;Bright
Little Valley&quot;-depending on where it has been sung. It is recognizable by
its chorus (with several variations):<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>From this valley they say you are going, <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>So remember the Red River Valley, <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>And the one that has loved you so true. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Edith Fowke offers anecdotal evidence that the song was
known in at least five Canadian provinces before 1896. This finding led to
speculation that the song was composed at the time of the Wolseley Expedition
to the northern Red River Valley of 1870 in Manitoba. It expresses the sorrow
of a local girl or woman (possibly a MŽtis, meaning of French and aboriginal
origin) as her soldier/lover prepares to return to Ontario.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The earliest written manuscript of the
lyrics, titled &quot;Red River Valley&quot;, bears the notations 1879 and 1885
in locations Nemha and Harlan in western Iowa, so it probably dates to at least
that era. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>RED HAIRED BOY - This tune goes by many different names
and there is debate about whether this is an Irish or Scottish tune.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is thought that the Red Haired Boy
was a general trouble maker.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Whatever its origin, this reel is a popular jam tune.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>RED WING - This popular song was written in 1907 with
music by Kerry Mills and lyrics by Thurland Chattaway. Mills adapted the music
from Robert A. Schumann's &quot;The Happy Farmer&quot;. The song tells of a
young Indian maid's loss of her sweetheart who has died in battle. It is most
memorable for its chorus:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Now, the moon shines tonight on pretty Red Wing,- <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The breeze is sighing,- the night bird's crying,- <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>For afar 'neath his star her brave is sleeping,- <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>While Red Wing's weeping- her heart away.- <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>BOOTH SHOT LINCOLN - Unhappy with the outcome of the
Civil War, John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865 at
Ford's Theater in Washington, DC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>President Lincoln, his family and a few friends, were watching a British
comedy called, Our American Cousin, Shortly before 10:30 PM, Booth, an actor
and southern sympathizer, entered the presidential box and shot Lincoln in the
back of the head with a derringer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Booth jumped from the box shouting, Sic semper tyrannis (Thus always to
tyrants!), and escaped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two Army
doctors rushed to the President's side and tried to revive him with artificial
respiration and brandy. Once his breathing was restored, he was moved to a
nearby boarding house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Lincoln died at 7:22 AM the following morning. He was the first American
president killed by an assassin's bullet. Vice President Andrew Johnson took
over Lincoln's duties as Chief Executive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Twelve days later Booth was found hiding in a barn in Maryland. He was shot
and killed by Federal troops. The tune Booth Shot Lincoln commemorates this
tragic event in American history.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>YEAR OF JUBILO - This is one of the most popular tunes of
the Civil War. Called Kingdom Come or Lincoln's Gunboats, but better known as
Year of Jubilo, it was written by Henry C. Work in 1862. You have probably
heard in the background of many cartoons<o:p></o:p></p>
