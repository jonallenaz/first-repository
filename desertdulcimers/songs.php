<h3>Words to <u>CLUCK OLD HEN</u>:</h3><p>My old hen&#8217;s a good old hen, she lays eggs for the railroad
men.<br />
Sometimes one, sometimes ten, that&#8217;s enough for the railroad men.</p>
<p>CHORUS:&nbsp; Cluck old hen, cluck and sing, ain&#8217;t laid an
egg since way last spring.<br />
Cluck old hen, cluck and squall, ain&#8217;t laid an egg since way last fall.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;ve been told, the streets of heaven are
lined with gold.<br />
And when I die, I&#8217;ll get there soon, I&#8217;ll sing this song and I&#8217;ll
fiddle this tune.&nbsp; CHORUS</p>
<p>Cluck old hen, I&#8217;ll tell you, cluck in the day and the
nighttime, too.<br />
Cluck in the yard, cluck in the lot, next time you cluck you&#8217;ll cluck
in the pot.&nbsp; CHORUS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><u>FORKED DEER</u></h3>
<p>Forked Deer is the quintessential <em>Old Timey</em>
tune. Originally called Van Buren, it most likely originated as a
campaign tune during the presidential election of 1836.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin Van buren had been Attorney General of New
York,
U.S. Senator, Governor of New York, Secretary of State, and Vice
President during Andrew Jackson's second term. He became the 8th
President of the United States in 1837.&nbsp; His contemporaries
thought highly of him. Washington Irving said he was <em>one of
the gentlest and most amiable men I have ever met.</em> Andrew
Jackson said he was <em>a true man with no guile</em>.&nbsp;
Posterity has been less kind. He is mostly remembered for the dismal
human rights record of his administration, i.e., the forced relocation
of the Cherokee Indians, extending slavery into the Western Territories
and the Amistad incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;By the time of the Civil
War Van
Buren's association with Andrew Jackson and his politics of compromise
had made him very unpopular. The fiddle tune carrying his name needed a
new title.&nbsp; In the summer of 1862, Confederate General Braxton
Bragg, went on the offensive. He overran Tennessee and nearly captured
Kentucky. The rapidity of his advance overwhelmed the opposing Union
commanders, but his victory was brief. &nbsp;Defeated at
Perryville,
Kentucky. Bragg was forced to retreat across much of the ground he had
gained. &nbsp;He made a stand at Murfreesboro (a.k.a. Stone's
River) on
December 31, 1862 and January 2, 1863, but was forced to withdraw
again. This failed campaign became known in the North as Bragg's
Retreat. It provided the new name for the tune Van Buren. At some point
after the Civil War political correctness in the south led to renaming
the tune Forked Deer. It is one of the best examples of how good tunes
survive regardless of contemporary associations.</p>

<h3><u>OLD YELLOW DOG</u></h3>
<p>The
whole title to this old time tune is Old Yellow Dog Came Trotting
Through the Meeting House. This tune is one that has many variants,
both in its name, and its melody. It is related to a tune called Old
Blind Dog, a tune popularized by east Tennessee fiddler Charlie Acuff.
The children's song The Old Grey Mare, She Ain't What She Used To Be is
also a descendant/variant of this tune.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><u>TURKEY</u><u> IN THE STRAW</u> </h3>
<p>Old
Time Music has many roots. One of the strangest is the minstrel show, a
peculiarly American entertainment. Developed in the 1840's it peaked in
popularity between 1850 and 1870, but survived into the 20th century
through the movies.&nbsp; Minstrel shows evolved from two types of
entertainment popular in America before 1830. The impersonation of
blacks by white actors between acts of plays and black street musicians
who performed with banjo accompaniment. The father of American
minstrelsy was Thomas Dartmouth Daddy Rice, who between 1828 and 1831
developed a song-and-dance routine in which he impersonated an old,
crippled black slave, called Jim Crow.&nbsp; Dan Emmett's Virginia
Minstrels, were one of the earliest troups. They first
performed&nbsp;
at New York's Bowery amphitheatre in 1843. The early minstrel shows
parodied popular topics using stock blackface characters such as Jim
Crow, an ignorant country bumpkin, and Zip Coon (derived from the name
Scipio), a self absorbed city slicker. The shows were in two parts. In
part one the performers were arranged in a semicircle, with a leader
(the interlocutor) in the center and Mr. Tambo, who played the
tambourine, and Mr. Bones, who played the bones, at opposing ends. The
interlocutor, in whiteface, wore formal attire; the others, in
blackface wore gaudy coats and striped trousers. The program opened
with a chorus followed by a series of jokes between the interlocutor
and end men, interspersed with ballads, comic songs, and instrumental
numbers, on the banjo and fiddle.&nbsp; The second part, or olio,
consisted of a series of short skits that concluded with a hoedown or
walk-around in which every member did a specialty number. <a target="_blank" href="http://hetzler.homestead.com/files/Old_Zip_Coon.mid">Old

Slippers</a>
(James Bland 1854-1911) are examples of walk-around tunes.&nbsp;
Minstrel shows exploited stereotypes, but helped blacks enter show
business after the Civil War. Ironically, early black minstrel troupes
corked their faces just like the white minstrel performers.&nbsp;
Unbelievable as it seems today, this was considered wholesome family
entertainment in the 1800s. White and black audiences viewed the
blatant racism of the songs and skits as acceptable.</p>
